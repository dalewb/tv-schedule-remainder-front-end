BingeWatch is an app to search, coordinate and schedule your favorite TV shows streaming and live.  We came up with this app idea because we wanted a way to itemize and schedule our favorite shows to see when they were airing and when we should be watching them.  There are so many shows to see but so little time (and time management)!

A user has the ability to search for any show that is currently being aired to add to their schedule.  The shows are found using the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) which list all seasons and episodes for that show.

The user can then select the appropriate show and see all available episodes with their scheduled times.  If a user wants to add an eppisode or multiple episodes, they would add hte show to their 'favorites' and select the episode(s) they wish to watch.  The episodes are then added to their schedule.
